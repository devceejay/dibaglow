Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it highlights clear service listing, builds trust with testimonials, answers client questions through a clear FAQ, and encourages conversions via an accessible contact form. It was created to demonstrate my ability to bring a wellness brand identity to life through thoughtful design and clean development practices.
